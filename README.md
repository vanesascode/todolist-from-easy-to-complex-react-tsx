# Todo Lists from easy to difficult:

### So far, added:

- Using useState with 1 and 3 components
- Using useReducer with 1 and 3 components, easier and more complex.

## ðŸŒŸVITE

- To create a project:

- [x] run: `npm create vite@latest`

select 'React' as the framework and select 'Javascript' as the variant.

- [x] run: `npm install` to install all the dependencies

---

- To run the project:

- [x] run: `npm run dev`

---

## ðŸŒŸTAILWIND

Go to the frameworks guides. [In this case for Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)

- [x] `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`

- [x] `npx tailwindcss init -p`

To generate a TypeScript config file, use the --ts flag:

- [x] `npx tailwindcss init --ts`

ðŸ’¡ Generate a complete configuration file that includes all of Tailwindâ€™s default configuration:

- [x] `npx tailwindcss init --full`

---

## ðŸŒŸDEPLOYMENT - VITE & VERCEL

Prepare your Vite application:

- [x] Run `npm run build`

In Vite, running the npm run build command triggers the build process, which generates a production-ready build of your application, the folder `dist`

If you don't have Vercel installed:

- [x] Create an account in Vercel.com
- [x] Install the Now package in the terminal, globally: `npm install now -g`
- [x] Run: `now` in the terminal, inside the root folder of the project.
- [x] The terminal will ask you your email.
- [x] Then, you'll receive an email in which you will have to verify your credentials.

Deployment steps:

- [x] Run: `now` again.
- [x] It will ask you if you want to deploy. You say Y
- [x] Asks the scope (your name)
- [x] Asks if you want to link to existing project. You say N
- [x] In which directory is your code located? If it's in the root folder just leave it like this: ./
- [x] You want to override the settings? You say N
- [x] You can now get the URL that is in the âœ… production line. It's live!

Add new changes to the live URL

- [x] Run: `now --prod` Then, changes are saved in the same URL you published before.

---

## ðŸŒŸREACT-ROUTER

- [x] Install: `npm install react-router-dom`
- [x] Import: `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";`

- [x] Create your Router in the higher component. Set the components you always want to appear, outsite of the Routes wrapping:

```
function App() {

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <Router>
        <Navbar />
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<ContactList />} />
            <Route path="/new" element={<ContactForm />} />
          </Routes>
        <Footer/>
        </Router>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### useNavigate (function to go to another path)

To be able to use it, the component has to be inside the `Router` wrapping.

```
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const handleClick = () => {
    navigate("/new");
  };

```

## ðŸŒŸCONTEXT-API

- [x] Create a separate file and import { createContext } (in this case it is in the `DataContext.tsx` file, in the folder `context`)

- [x] Create a `Context`. With Typescript, you'll first need to create a context type:

```
interface DataContextType {
  contactList: ContactInterface[] | null;
  setContactList: Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<ContactInterface[]>>;
  buttonOn: boolean;
  setButtonOn: Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}

//CONTEXT://

const DataContext = createContext<DataContextType>({
  contactList: null,
  setContactList: () => {},
  buttonOn: false,
  setButtonOn: () => {},
});
```

- [x] Create a `Provider` function with all the states you want to store in you context api.

- [x] In you return, wrap children with the Provider:

```
  return (
    <DataContext.Provider
      value={{ contactList, setContactList, buttonOn, setButtonOn }}
    >
      {children}
    </DataContext.Provider>
  );

```

- [x] In your `App.tsx` file or in your higher one in the tree, wrap all the components you want to benefit from the context api with the provider:

```
return (
    <>
      <div className="sm:max-container">
        {/* ROUTES */}
        <Router>
          <DataProvider>
            {/* NAVBAR */}
            <Navbar />
            <Routes>
              <Route path="/" element={<ContactList />} />
              <Route path="/new" element={<ContactForm />} />
            </Routes>
          </DataProvider>
        </Router>
      </div>
    </>
  );
```

## ðŸŒŸUUID

- [x] `npm i uuid`

## ðŸŒŸREACT-ICONS

- [x] `npm i react-icons`

Example:

```
import { TiDelete } from 'react-icons/ti';

const ExpenseItem = () => {


	return (

				<TiDelete size='1.5em' />

	);
};

export default ExpenseItem;

```

You also have 'color' as a key to change.
